# Module 2 Challenge

The purpose of this analysis is to walk one through the process in which I worked through this module, how it improved my analytics skills, shortcomings in my skill, pros and cons of VBA, and Next Steps. With very little VBA experience I was struggled to run such a seemingly powerful but restrictive software such as VBA. This is especially true when comparing it to Python.

Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.

## What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
#### Advantages
Better comprehension as base is already created and facilitates learning through maintenance and improvement of the given software	
#### Disadvantages
If refactoring is not done systemically it can introduce new errors to the code and make identifying the error more difficult

#### Pros of VBA
Powerful software that can be relied on for consistency. If set up properly, someone with little Excel knowledge can make use of your macro.
#### Cons of VBA
Reliant on VBA and follows strict principles to run data. Offers less freedom than program such as Python in temr sof what one can do with it.

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
Refactoring when done correctly can maintain clean code and evolve its architecture while reducing the amount of bugs. Conversley, it is time consuming for the developer and can create some issues with opening files (MACRO enabled and .vbs files) and if Excel is updated then that can off-set the code outcome.

## Moving Forward
Will continue to develop my skills in VBA as I progress in analytics whilst sustaining my creative mindset
## Perspective
Compared to working with VBA, normal Excel formulas appear easy. With Google anything can be found instantly, feels like it has opened doors for me in gritt and a "winning" mindset. What I mean by this is to not be defeated nor intimidated by the appearnace of an application rather throw oneself at it and ifgure it out.
